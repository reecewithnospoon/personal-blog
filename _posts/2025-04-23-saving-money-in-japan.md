Moving to Japan is an exciting adventure, but the cost of living can be a shock—especially in big cities like Tokyo or Osaka. Here are some practical tips to help you save money and make the most of your new life in Japan.

---

### 1. Master the Supermarket Game

- **Shop at discount supermarkets** like OK Store, Gyomu Super, or Hanamasa for bulk and cheaper groceries.
- **Look for yellow stickers** (割引, waribiki) in the evenings—these indicate discounts on fresh food nearing its sell-by date.
- **Try 100 yen shops** (Daiso, Seria, Can Do) for household goods, snacks, and even some groceries.

---

### 2. Eat Out Strategically

- **Lunch specials (ランチセット, ranchi setto)** at restaurants are often much cheaper than dinner.
- **Convenience stores** (konbini) offer affordable, decent meals—look for discounted bentos after 7pm.
- **Chain restaurants** like Sukiya, Matsuya, and Yoshinoya offer filling meals for under 500 yen.

---

### 3. Transportation Hacks

- **Get a commuter pass (定期券, teikiken)** if you travel the same route daily—it can save a lot over single fares.
- **Use a bicycle** for short trips; many cities are bike-friendly and it saves on train/bus fares.
- **Walk when possible**—it’s healthy and free!

---

### 4. Housing and Utilities

- **Share housing** (share houses or guesthouses) can be much cheaper than renting your own apartment, especially when starting out.
- **Look for apartments with no key money (礼金, reikin)** and low deposit (敷金, shikikin).
- **Be mindful of utility usage**—electricity and gas can be expensive, especially in winter and summer.

---

### 5. Mobile and Internet

- **Avoid the big three (Docomo, au, SoftBank)** for mobile plans. Instead, use MVNOs like Rakuten Mobile, LINEMO, or IIJmio for cheaper SIM cards.
- **Check if your apartment includes free internet**—many do, especially in share houses.

---

### 6. Entertainment and Social Life

- **Enjoy free or low-cost activities**: parks, shrines, festivals, and city events.
- **Use public libraries** for books, study space, and sometimes even free Japanese classes.
- **Look for happy hour deals** (ハッピーアワー) at bars and izakayas.

---

### 7. Banking and Money Transfers

- **Use online banks** (like Sony Bank or Rakuten Bank) to avoid ATM fees.
- **For sending money home**, use services like Wise (formerly TransferWise) or Revolut for better rates than traditional banks.

---

### 8. Learn Basic Japanese

- Even a little Japanese helps you spot deals, understand contracts, and avoid tourist traps.
- Free resources: NHK Easy News, Duolingo, or local city hall classes.

### 9. Utilize Point Cards (V-Point, Rakuten, WAON, and More)

Japan has a widespread point card culture that can help you save money on everyday purchases. Many stores, supermarkets, and even convenience stores offer their own loyalty programs. Here’s how to make the most of them:

- **Sign up for point cards** such as V-Point (Visa affiliated), Rakuten Point, WAON Point (Aeon group), T-Point, and others. Registration is usually free and can often be done at the register or online.
- **Present your card or app** every time you shop to accumulate points. Points can typically be redeemed for discounts or even free items on future purchases.
- **Many cards are now digital**—download the relevant app to your smartphone for easy management and to avoid carrying multiple physical cards.
- **Combine points with store sales and coupons** for even greater savings.
- **Popular chains and where to use them:**
  - **V-Point:** Many Visa-affiliated stores and online shops.
  - **Rakuten Point:** Rakuten services, Lawson, McDonald's, and more.
  - **WAON Point:** Aeon group stores, Ministop, and others.
  - **T-Point:** FamilyMart, Tsutaya, and more.

Taking advantage of these point systems can add up to significant savings over time, especially if you shop at the same stores regularly.

I underestimated the power of Japanese point cards when I first arrived, but after using them, I wish I had started sooner.
